# FinalExam

This is my final exam for my apprenticeship at Max Eyth Schule, Kirchheim/Teck, Germany.
I created this program with java. It was written to show queries in the ERP System of Taifun Software AG that the main programm doesn't has. If you are interested in this program and you want to use this by yourself, dont't hesitate to modify the code as you like.

Requirements to run this programm:

JRE 8

functional MySQL/MS SQL server
